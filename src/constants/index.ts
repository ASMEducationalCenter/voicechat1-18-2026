    question: "What are the three principles of the CIA Triad?",
    modelAnswer:
      `The CIA Triad represents three core principles of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users. This is achieved through encryption, authentication, and access controls. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered. Security tools such as hashing and digital signatures help verify that information has not been tampered with. Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed. Organizations maintain backups, redundant systems, and protection against outages or attacks.`,
    realWorldExamples: [
      "An online banking system uses encryption and authentication to protect customer account information.",
      "A company uses backup servers so employees can continue working even if one system fails.",

  {
    id: 22,
    question: "Why is logging important in cybersecurity?",
    modelAnswer:
      `Logging is the process of recording system activities and events within a network or computer system. Logs provide valuable information about what actions occurred, when they happened, and who performed them. Security teams rely on logs to detect suspicious activity, investigate security incidents, and maintain accountability. Logs help identify unusual behavior such as repeated login failures, unauthorized access attempts, or unexpected system changes. Logging also supports compliance and auditing requirements. Many organizations must maintain logs to meet regulatory standards and demonstrate that they are monitoring their systems. Security tools such as SIEM platforms analyze logs from multiple systems to detect patterns that may indicate cyberattacks.`,
